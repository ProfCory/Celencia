**Plot Notes – The Green Book, Curse, and Aberrant Entity**

---

### 🟩 The Green Book(s)
- A magical tome of aberrant origin.
- Content adapts or shifts depending on who reads it.
- Two known copies: one found in Havelshire, another recovered by Myran in Vestille.
- Possibly tied to the Cult of the Forbidden Eye and the Third Circle’s past actions.

---

### 💀 The Curse
- Affects the minds of those who spend time reading the book.
- Symptoms include:
  - Dream sickness
  - Memory loss and mental obsession
  - Hallucinations or altered perception
- Victims may act as conduits or “hosts” for the aberrant entity.
- Exposure appears to form a lingering tether to the creature—even after leaving the book behind.

### 👁️ The Aberrant Entity
- Unnamed and possibly unnameable—tied to dream or psychic realms.
- Plane Seeing Orb shows those affected surrounded by alien dreamscapes.
- Seems connected to a dream or reflection realm (cracks in sky, writhing clouds, alien chanting).
- Not fully present in the world yet—anchored through the books, dreams, and corrupted minds.
- May feed on creativity, obsession, or unfulfilled potential.

### 🔺 Known Connections
- **The Third Circle** may have discovered or accidentally released it.
- **Cult of the Forbidden Eye** worships or seeks to awaken the entity.
- **Name Keepers** were mentioned in research—might hold its name or keep it bound.
- **Tori’s sister** is deeply affected; her obsession visible through the orb.
- **Havelshire** remains a psychic hotspot.

### 📛 Leads on Its Name
- The entity’s true name is unknown—possibly dangerous to speak or comprehend.
- The **Cult of the Forbidden Eye** may know or seek the name.
- **Name Keepers** exist to remember such names without invoking them.
- Thalion saw text in the orb that was not his own obsession—this could suggest it speaks through others.
- The shifting nature of the Green Book might hide syllables, sounds, or ideograms of its name within.
- The being may have **many names** across planes and cultures, all partial or flawed reflections.
- The phrase “in the cracks” recurs in visions, possibly part of a naming metaphor or ritual phrase.

### 🧭 Leads and Clues
- The orb can detect residual connections to the creature.
- The green books may be keys or sympathetic objects.
- The map labeled “The Wriggled Scrawl” in Karegal could lead to a nest, binding site, or cult cell.
- The books, even when unread, influence dreams and thought.

---

### 🧠 Party Theories (So Far)
- The book(s) are fragments of the creature itself—split to weaken or hide it.
- Reading the book is akin to “looking through” the world—its influence comes from what’s behind the page.
- Tori’s sister may not be fully herself anymore and could be a psychic bridge to the entity.
- The creature is not bound by time—it sees past, present, and future dreamers at once.
- The creature isn’t just trying to come through—it’s **already here**, speaking to those who’ve seen the cracks.
