 Session 37 

The main party and the side party both found themselves on a large solitary mountain facing several hostile creatures. Each party engaged from opposite sides. 

Njal, riding Orm, smashed his warhammer into the side of the huge crater in the centre of the mountain, breaking the rock beneath the feet of the biggest creature and it lost its footing and fell. (edited)
