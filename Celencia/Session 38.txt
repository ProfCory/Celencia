Session 38

Ki-Sai followed Njal's lead and drove his feet into another ice giant, knocking it also into the crater.  Then Thalion mentally shoved another into the pit and threw a fireball at them.  As the ice giants died they melted and the crater started to slowly fill with water.

The massive golem of battle recovered its footing and began to climb out of the crater, whereupon a crazy shirtless Orc leapt off the side of the crater and grappled its head.

Eventually the enemies were all dispatched, with Brak ending the battle by wrenching off the golem's head, with a crowbar.

Karegan told them a tale of an ancient people who once lived here. They were destroyed during a magical war which created the crater and also prompted the unwritten rules preventing magic users taking a direct part in future wars.
