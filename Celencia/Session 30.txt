Session 30

Myran finished off the last boar with a whack of her staff and the orcs set to work ritually harvesting resources from their bodies.  They distributed trophies of tusks according to merit in the battle and continued their journey with spirits somewhat lighter and bonds, even friendships, somewhat closer.

On the journey Brotak took Yves under his wing for some so called Orcish military strength training.  Myran experimented with some magical liquid.  Lightning struck a tree and Ki-Sai took a piece of the scorched wood to add to his yet to be carved dragonchess set of memories.

Eventually they reached the impressive city of Rux-Ogar, all the more remarkable for its relatively young age.  Brotak was due to meet with the city leaders to report back on his mission.  Yves persuaded them to allow him and his companions to attend one of the less sensitive meetings.
